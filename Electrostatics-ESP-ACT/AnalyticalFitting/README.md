The Input4Fitting.py script generates JSON files and the initial data for ESP fitting from Hartree-Fock level calculations. It produces data based on grids starting from 0 A as well as from 2.0 A. Next, Fit_ESP-4models.py computes the electrostatic potential for each ion and determines the parameters for each charge model. Finally, Electrostatic_4models.py can be used to calculate the electrostatic interactions for each model and to plot the SAPT0 electrostatics for the interactions between each ion pair.
